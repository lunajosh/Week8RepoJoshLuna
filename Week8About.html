<!--this section is a little info about myself and my experience with photography-->
    <p>Thank you for visiting this page. Located in Denver, CO, Josh Luna uses solely 
        Canon products (5D Mark IV along with L quality Canon lenses) to create beautiful images. 
        I enjoy taking pictures and would be happy to create memories for you and your family.
